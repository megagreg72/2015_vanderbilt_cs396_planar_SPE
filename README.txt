All remaining, relavant artifacts have been gathered here, years after the fact.
This course project was fairly open-ended, 
but the goal was basically to do some research using what we learned in the rest of the class.
A template for the final report was provided (included here).
I do not still have any other documents describing exactly what was expected for this assignment,
(perhaps I lost such documents, or perhaps the requirements were simply stated in class)
As best as I can remember, we were supposed to:
	submit a proposal (so that the Dr. Yevgeniy could tell us whether or not he thought the idea was worth pursuing),
	submit a progress report partway through,
	submit a final report,
	and finally, present our results to the class.
	
The research done in the course did not necessarily have to be publishable,
but in my case, after the course, this project eventually became the published paper:

Gan, Jiarui, Bo An, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik, and Brian Gauch. 
"Security Games on a Plane." 
In AAAI, pp. 530-536. 2017.

The above paper is NOT included here as artifact of "my" ability because my involvement was mostly in the form of the pilot work done in this project.  However, the curious reader can find the final paper at http://www.briangauch.com/
